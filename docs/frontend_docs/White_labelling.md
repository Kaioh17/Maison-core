# White-Labeling Overview - What It Is & Where It's Applied

## What is White-Labeling?

White-labeling is a business model where one company (us - Maison) creates a product or service that other companies (tenants) can rebrand and customize as their own. Think of it as providing a "blank canvas" platform that tenants can paint with their own brand colors, logo, and business identity.


## Why White-Labeling Matters for Maison

**This is one of our most important features and competitive advantages.** Instead of building their own ride-hailing platform from scratch (which costs millions and takes years), businesses can use our proven platform and make it look and feel like their own product.

### Business Benefits:
- **Faster Market Entry**: Tenants can launch their branded ride service in weeks, not years
- **Lower Development Costs**: No need to build everything from scratch
- **Proven Technology**: They get our tested, reliable platform
- **Scalability**: Built-in infrastructure that grows with their business
